// Write a function generate_binary_numbers that takes a number N as a parameter and returns a queue of binary number strings from 1 to N without using any built-in or library functions like bin(). 
// In fact, your solution should not use any built-in or library functions other than those in the Stack and Queue classes provided. The front of the queue begins @ '1'. If N is too small, return an empty queue. 
// A successful solution does not calculate binary numbers mathematically but only adds strings together.

// from Queue import Queue
